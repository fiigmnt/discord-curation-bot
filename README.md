# CURRATION Bot ðŸ¤–

>it's probably nothing

## TL;DR

A general use bot to aggregate content based on discord reactions.  âœ¨

## How it Works

1. Upvote posts in by reacting with a specified emoji (ex: ðŸ“°)
2. Five ðŸ“° will trigger the bot to post into the specified channel (id supplied via env var)
3. The community can use these votes to further curate the content ðŸ¤™

## Setup

1. Fork the repository to your gihub account (top right hand corner)
2. Clone the fork to your local system
3. Install Node modules `npm install`
4. Run with the following process variables:
   `CURATE_FROM` :point_right: list of channel ids separated by a comma (no spaces)
   `POST_TO` :point_right: channel id to post to
   `TOKEN` :point_right: the bot's token :mushroom:

## Submitting your improvements

1. Create a new branch `git check -b <your branch name>`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m 'fix(example): semantic versioning is cool'`
4. `git push`
5. Grab that PR and point it to our main branch
6. Message with changes for a review ! :v:
